  kinematics_solver_type: Distance #Returns first solution
  # Other types:
  # Distance: Runs until timeout, returns solution that minimizes SSE from the seed
  # Manip 1: Runs until timeout, returns solution that maximizes sqrt(det(J*J^T))
  # Manip 2: Runs until timeout, returns solution that minimizes cond(J) = |J||J^-1|
